> *"One of the things I really like doing the most is challenging myself to learn very insteting things, and so far, learning about web development is one of the bestest things I've never imagined to learn before"*

Greetings cyber people, the person whom you're reading to is called **Jhon Alessandro**, however; You have the option of calling me `MasterAless` or `TheBox`. The story beyond these two nicknames are short and I'll explain them to you very soon (*let me first learn more about this stuff about markdown and writing such goods **readme.md** files*).

I can give you a short approach to them:

- `MasterAless` is the nickname I use to teach to other people, In fact a I have a **TikTok** channel where I teach about *English stuff* such pieces of advices, vocabulary, mindset changing, exmaples, explanation, and many other interesting stuff. If you want to check out my work in my **TikTok** channel feel welcome to get using this link: [@master_Aless](http://tiktok.com/@master_aless)
> A friend of mine once called me -> ***Master English*** whereas I called him ***Master Trader*** so the inspiration to choose that name comes from that moment.
- `TheBox` which is originally `TheBoxHeadGuy` is my *programmer's nickname*. Very cool, isn't? It is the nickname who writes code when has an idea to be developed or a solution to be created, therefore is also the person behind this words. As a great web developer, I have a github account, so If you want to see all the projects, and cool stuff I'll be developing check it out, it is **free** [The-BoxHead-Guy](https://github.com/The-BoxHead-Guy)

Stay in touch because I'm going to keep the actualization of this **readme.md** often.
